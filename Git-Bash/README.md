# Basic Git + Linux + Bash Assignment

The basic lecture provided some foundation on git and linux concepts and so we wish to enhance the same using the assignments below

## Basic Problems (Based on the Resources Provided )
1. All questions of missing semester first two lectures as provided in the bottom of the lectures. (Try to reseach and write clear explanations for each answer)
2. [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) first 15 labs (try to do them after the missing semester and on your own and ask seniors if you are stuck)
3. Write a bash script to automate any task in linux or macOS or WSL(it can be as basic as changing the extension of image from png to jpg when put in a particular folder )(**bonus for more creative or difficult task)
4. Also you need to setup GPG and SSH keys for your system on GitHub (read the doc and ask for doubts). These are used for setting up `git clone` using ssh and also signing and verification of commits.

You also need to create a documentation for the first two tasks with the commands and their outputs.
Make the submissions in the same folder by creating a directory with name `<your-name>` and try to maintain a PR of the submission as soon as possible. 
The deadline for submission is 30th April (most tasks can be completed within a day ;-))

P.S. You are encouraged to discuss and help each other in the process, preferably having a thread of discussion within slack. No plagiarism of each other's work will be tolerated and we may verify your submissions by asking you relevant questions about the same.
